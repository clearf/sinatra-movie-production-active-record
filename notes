Things I would do if I had more time:

-Allow the user to type in any name for a film's director, check the database for that name, and if the name is absent, ask user if he wants to add to contacts

-Comment code and check for consistent indenting and quotation marks (double v. single)

-On edit task page, initialize drop-down menus to display the name of the current assignee/film

-Alphabetize the contact and movie lists

-Make notation of the booleans entirely consistent ('y' or 'n' to the user)
